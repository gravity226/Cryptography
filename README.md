# Decryption + Data Science = ?

### Summary
For this little project I want to learn more about Decryption.  Encrypting and Decrypting a file with a key seems pretty straight forward to me.  So for this project I want to encrypt documents with a key and then throw away that key and attempt to decrypt them with some of the skills I've learned in data science.  I will start with the very basic Caesar Cipher and move on from there.
